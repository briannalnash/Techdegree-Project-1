        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I am a 7 year military veteran air traffic controller and I met my husband overseas in Kuwait. In 2012, I opened a yoga studio, and closed it in 2013 due to my husband recieving a job offer to work 3 hours away. Ever since then I have tried to find some way to work from home</p>
        <p>I've worked as a virtual assistant for the past 5 years with many online coaches, marketing specialists, lawyers and more. I've helped develop email marketing campaigns, affiliate campaigns and have helped craft and launch different online programs.</p>
        <p>After working for a few years with different clients, I began to dive deeper into the realm of code. A client would ask me to change something here and there and it would require me to do research to figure out how to achieve what they were asking. Thankfully, reading HTML and CSS code wasn't to astronomically hard for me in the beginning. It was only when I started diving deeper into "fixing" issues did it become apparant that I needed to learn more. Not to mention I was thoroughly enjoying learning about code.</p>
        <p>This is what led me to finding a way to become a full stack developer. I wanted to help those who weren't as tech savvy to accomplish their awesome goals while also being paid like a developer to do it.</p>
